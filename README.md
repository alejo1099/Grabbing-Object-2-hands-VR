# Grabbing Objects with 2 controls in VR
Grabbing Objects with 2 controls in VR,  Rotate an Object with 2 positions, Follow a target without lose orientation 
This code allow the user rotate a object with 1 or 2 points of reference

The problem of the target
For understand how this work, think in a sphere and a object wich we call target. Now imagine a line betweenthe sphere's position and the target's position.
The target can move, but the sphere can't. The line change while the target moves, and we can say that the line seems cutting the sphere
